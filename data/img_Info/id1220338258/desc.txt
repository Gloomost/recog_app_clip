5/5 - "Easy to learn and play. You will meet a lot of good people to play with.”
4/5 - "It’s better than Mobile Strike.”
5/5 - "Closest I've found to mobile strike. This game is, in my opinion, much fairer as MS has turned into a game for the rich who can buy daily updates.”
4/5 - "I really like this game. It helps me think and relax.”
5/5 - "Amazing. Really enjoying. Same as others I agree, but it's young. It's like playing Mobile Strike two or so years ago. Yet this game still thinks of the players and not the money. Great jobs ladies and gents”
