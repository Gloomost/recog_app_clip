A fish out of water is like a bird with broken wings. It will die soon. The little octopus came ashore from the sea to play and got lost. Now the little octopus is very anxious because it can no longer find water. It can't survive. It can't walk very long. Please help it reach the water source in the shortest way and rescue the little octopus.
