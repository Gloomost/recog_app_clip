Basic rules: A fun and educational card flip memory game. During the short card flip process, you need to remember the pattern of the cards. When the patterns of two cards are the same, they will be matched and eliminated!
Additional experience: There are levels of different difficulty in the game for players to choose and experience; the game also designs different background color themes to adapt to players with different needs and avoid visual fatigue for players!
I hope players can release the stress in life through this game!
