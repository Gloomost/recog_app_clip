Critical Mass is a game set in the future, where you are the commander of a squadron of spaceships. You will be sent on one of 46 different types of mission, ranging from protecting a convoy, to attacking an enemy starbase, to defending Earth.You fight enemy spaceships using six different types of missiles which home in on the nearest target, so you have to be careful not to destroy your own friends. Defend yourself with forcefields, or cloak to go invisible, and hyperspace out of there if things aren't looking good.The game is turn based, but with missiles homing in on your tail, enemy ships weaving to get out of your line of sight and sirens screaming warnings at you it can get pretty frantic!After the mission you can replay the entire battle from the point of view of your or any of your squadron members' spaceships.
