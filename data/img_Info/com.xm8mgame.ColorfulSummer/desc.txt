The beach in summer is the most beautiful gift given to us by nature. When the summer sun falls on the golden beach, the waves pat the shore, bringing a gust of cool sea breeze, as if you are in paradise.Away from the hustle and bustle of the city, I came to this paradise of leisure. Walking at a brisk pace, I walked to the beach, feeling the touch of the soft sand slipping gently under my feet, as if to welcome me.
