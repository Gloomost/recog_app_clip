The grittiest idle mafia simulation game out there!

Manage insidious businesses, gather talented Capos to carry out your bidding, and occupy new territory through any means necessary.

 - Do what you want: take protection fees, rob anyone, fight on the streets... Be a benevolent leader or a ruthless crime lord. Who you steal from and what you steal is all up to you!
 - Make tons of money: set up casinos, gentlemen's clubs, or even an adult studio empire! You'll need cash businesses to keep things running smoothly.
 - Grow from a no-name gang into an international crime syndicate: from stealing to kidnapping, nothing is off limits unless you say so.
 - Expand your territory: occupy streets and cities to build your own Mafia empire. Tear down those who stand in your way, and recruit loyal followers to your cause.
 - Collect Capos: infamous criminals from around the world with special abilities that set them apart. Whether it's a horde of robot ninjas or luchadore accountants, become a force to be reckoned with!
 - Idle Cash: you're the boss here - sit back and enjoy as your loyal minions handle all the dirty work. Behind every successful fortune is a crime!
