The current version of My WiFi is developed entirely according to my daily needs, and personally I think it's still very well done, and the pages look great!
I hope you can make some more suggestions! I will always read your suggestions and make changes, but don't scold me! (I am very weak inside)
If I can get good comments from everyone, I will be very happy and more motivated to develop!
