In the game, called Marine biological matching, you have to carefully find a matching pattern in the bottom bar, select it and drag it into the corresponding blank shape. Only when the corresponding pattern is matched, it can be placed in the vacant position. As you progress through the level, it gets harder and harder. Are you ready to take on the challenge?
