Buddhist melodies are characterized as being strong, but not fierce; soft, but not weak; pure, but not dry; still, but not sluggish, and able to help purify the hearts of listeners. By listening to it, you can enrich and reenergize your hearts, reach the most remote places, and overcome the limitations of time and distance, as well as differences in cultural backgrounds and nationalities.
