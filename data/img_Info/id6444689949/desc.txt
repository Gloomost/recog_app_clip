My Sushi Story is a restaurant business simulation game that brings happiness to players. It features a wide variety of decor, appetizing Japanese dishes, and lovely characters.

The customers are upset? The staff is slacking off? The restaurant is too small? The food is bad?

You will go through the story of the restaurant in the game. It all begins when my grandma went to travel the world, leaving behind a slightly run-down sushi restaurant and a clumsy employeeâ€”Ono Ryota.

Running a sushi restaurant of my own has always been my dream, but I have no prior experience in doing so. For the sake of my dream and to fulfill my grandma's instructions, Ono and I embark on a journey of running a restaurant that is soothing, hilarious, and filled with ups and downs!

In this game, you will play as the boss of the sushi restaurant. You will create an assortment of Japanese dishes, make the daily purchasing plan, serve the customers, train the chefs and waiters, purchase items in the restaurants, and open a chain store.
