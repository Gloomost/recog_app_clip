“We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit”, This quote from Aristotle goes to the heart of our philosophy. We believe establishing good daily habits and healthy routines are necessary to thrive. This is what we aim to achieve: to help our users develop good habits and daily routines, like following a morning exercise routine or tidying their rooms, and to consistently repeat those actions until they become habits integrated into their lifestyle. This will enable people to lead a wholesome and fulfilling life.

Of course, accessibility is important. This is why Me+ now provides a daily routine planner and self-care schedule to establish a healthy habit and help with your daily routine. By repeating good actions daily and following your planner and self-care schedule, you will gain a new outlook, confidence, and strength. Obstacles that seemed unsurpassable will soon be overcome and forgotten.
