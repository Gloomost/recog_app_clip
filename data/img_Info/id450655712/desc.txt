Sleep, Focus, Productive, Spiritual healing, Health, Relax and Meditate, with Music Made for Your Brain. 

Backed by neuroscience and research, advanced binaural brainwave induction combined with ambient nature sounds is proven to help you drop into deep focus, fall asleep faster, increase creativity, and more.

Brainwaves uses low, mid, and high frequency ranges of Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma binaural tones combined in layers and stages to create powerful multi-stage experiences.

Unlike traditional meditation programs, Brainwaves gently and naturally guides your brain through a broad range of brainwave patterns, instead of just a meditative state.

Only Brainwaves large selection of sessions includes over 10 distinct outcomes:
• Focus faster and get into flow. 
• Beat procrastination.
• Fall asleep and stay asleep.
• Meditate more effectively.
• Reduce tension/anxiety by 2x compared to other relaxing music.
• Improve brain signatures of deep sleep 
• Relax deeply: Deep Delta Relaxation, Deep Muscle Relaxation and more
• Journey to the spiritual world: Third Eye Opening, Fifth Dimension and more
• In good health: Cell Regeneration, Pineal Gland Function HT, DNA Repair and more
• More wealth: Money Magnet, Path to Success and more
• Awakening energy: Inner Balance, Profound Energy Lift and more
• Healing our body and mind: 963 Hz Spiritual Healing, Trauma Healing, 528Hz Healing Session and more
• Increase our happiness: Happy Hormones, You are Love and Light and more

After just 30 minutes of Brainwaves use, studies have shown a 38.5% decrease in stress! 
Research shows that after some people listen to brain waves for 30 days
23% IQ increase on average
98% increase in melatonin (sleep better)
43% increase in DHEA
46% decrease in cortisol (stress)

* Our features*

Brainwaves use the latest brainwave entrainment (large-scale electrical oscillations in the brain that will naturally synchronize to the rhythm of periodic external stimuli) technology combined with neuroscience and psychology. And all the Isochronic Tones are 320 Bitrate! 
Looking at the effects of our brainwaves music using fMRI and EEG, the brain state is more active while listening to our brainwave music than listening to other music.

Brainwaves serves to balance your nervous system against the stressors of everyday life. Daily brain tapping trains your brain to be resilient and creative, and it activates the right mental states at the right time. In other words, you become the best version of yourself!

* How it works *

Different states of mind are associated with specific brainwave frequencies that would be inaudible if played directly. These frequencies can be induced in the brain by playing two different tones into each ear (binaural tones), which after being processed by the brain, are perceived as an inaudible beat matching the target brainwave frequency. As you listen, your own brainwaves fall into step and synchronize with this frequency.

As an example, the human ear can't directly perceive the 0.5 - 2 Hz Delta wave frequencies associated with deep sleep because it is well below the human hearing range, but if you wear headphones or earbuds with one side playing a 135 Hz tone and the other playing a 136 Hz tone, your brain will perceive the 1 Hz difference between those frequencies as a periodic beat, in this case matching a low delta wave frequency associated with sleep. As you listen, your own brainwaves will begin to match that frequency.
